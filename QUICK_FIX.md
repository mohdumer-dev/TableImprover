# ðŸš¨ QUICK FIX FOR CORRUPTED LOCALSTORAGE

## Immediate Fix (Run in Browser Console):

1. **Open your browser's Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Paste and run this code:**

```javascript
// Clear corrupted localStorage
localStorage.removeItem("UniData");
localStorage.setItem("UniData", JSON.stringify({ 
    activeItem: "dashboard",
    completed: "false" 
}));
console.log("âœ… localStorage fixed!");
// Refresh the page
window.location.reload();
```

## What This Does:
- âœ… Removes the corrupted `UniData` entry
- âœ… Creates fresh, clean localStorage data
- âœ… Refreshes the page to apply changes

## After Running:
Your app should work perfectly without any JSON parsing errors!

## Long-term Fix Applied:
I've updated your code to automatically handle corrupted localStorage:
- âœ… `getData.js` - Now handles JSON parsing errors gracefully
- âœ… `addLocal.js` - Now handles corrupted data safely  
- âœ… `resetLocalStorage.js` - New utility to reset corrupted data
- âœ… All pages now auto-detect and fix corrupted localStorage

Your app will automatically recover from localStorage corruption in the future!
